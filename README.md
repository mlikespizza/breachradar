# 🚨 BreachRadar – Real-Time Cyber Threat Simulation & Monitoring

BreachRadar is a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) project that mimics real-world cyber threat detection using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and a custom-built Python log simulator. It’s designed to visualize and analyze security events in real time using dynamic dashboards and custom log generation.

---

## Stack Used

- **Python**: Generates simulated security log events (e.g., XSS, SQLi, brute-force)
- **Filebeat**: Ships logs to Logstash
- **Logstash**: Parses and filters logs into structured data
- **Elasticsearch**: Stores and indexes the data
- **Kibana**: Visualizes and monitors security incidents
- **Docker**: Manages services in isolated containers

## How It Works

1. **Python Simulator (`simulator/log_generator.py`)**  
   Continuously generates random security log events and appends them to `generated.log`.

2. **Filebeat**  
   Monitors the `generated.log` file and ships logs to Logstash.

3. **Logstash**  
   Parses logs using custom patterns and sends structured JSON to Elasticsearch.

4. **Elasticsearch**  
   Stores and indexes the data in real-time.

5. **Kibana**  
   Provides a live dashboard where attacks like SQL injection, XSS, port scanning, etc., are visualized.

## Python Log Simulator (Run this first)

```bash
cd simulator
python log_generator.py
````

---

## Running the ELK Stack

```bash
cd elk-stack
docker-compose up -d
```

* Kibana: [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)
* Elasticsearch: [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200)

Make sure logs are being generated and Filebeat is shipping them.

---

## 📊 Kibana Dashboard

Search sample (KQL):

```
message: "*SQL*" or message: "*XSS*" or message: "*brute-force*" or message: "*Unauthorized*"
```

Visualize top threats by frequency using pie charts, bar graphs, or timelines.
